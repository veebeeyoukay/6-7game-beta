## ❓ FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

**Q: Is this screen time?**
A: It's *productive* screen time. The Watch App is designed for quick, focused interactions (1-2 minutes) to complete math battles or check off chores, preventing the "zombie scroll" effect.

**Q: Can I manage two households?**
A: Yes! Our **Multi-Parent** architecture supports modern families. A child can be part of a family account managed by multiple adults, ensuring everyone stays in the loop.

**Q: How does the AI work?**
A: We use advanced AI (Google Gemini) strictly to generate educational content. We do *not* train models on your child's personal data or behavior.

**Q: What devices do I need?**
A: Parents need an iPhone or Android phone. Kids get the best experience with an Apple Watch (Series 4 or newer), but can also play on a tablet or phone.
