## 1. Brand Overview

### 1.1 Brand Essence

**"Your World is Six-Seven. Let's Make It AWESOME."**

The 6-7 Game transforms the mundane "six out of seven" reality of daily life into an adventure worth playing. We believe every child's world — from their bedroom to the universe — can level up through learning, play, and creative mastery.

### 1.2 Mission Statement

**"Transforming screen time into learning time."**

Built by a family, for families. We're on a journey from "so-so" to awesome.

### 1.3 Origin Story

The name "6-7" comes from the universal experience of rating your current state as "six out of seven" — not terrible, but not amazing. The game exists to help kids (and families) break through that ceiling and reach their full potential.

### 1.4 Core Values

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **Fun First** | If it's not fun, kids won't play. Education is the hidden ingredient, not the selling point. |
| **Learn Always** | Every interaction teaches something — academics, financial literacy, time management, AI skills. |
| **Fair Play** | Family battles adjust to each player's level. A 2nd grader can genuinely compete with a 5th grader. |
| **Creative Freedom** | Kids command AI bots, customize their worlds, and make meaningful choices. |

## 2. Visual Identity

### 2.1 Visual Evolution System

The 6-7 Game's signature visual mechanic is **progressive graphics evolution**:

| Level Range | Visual Style | Description |
|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| 1-3 | 8-bit Pixel Art | Gritty, nostalgic, intentionally "boring" starting point |
| 4-6 | 16-bit Pixel Art | Colors pop, details emerge, world feels more alive |
| 7-9 | 32-bit Graphics | Smooth animations, richer environments |
| 10-11 | HD Cartoon | Full cartoon-quality characters and worlds |

**Key Insight:** This visual progression creates tangible, visible proof of achievement. Kids can literally *see* themselves leveling up.

### 2.2 Color Palette

Based on the website and brand positioning:

| Color | Hex | Usage |
|-------|-----|-------|
| **Deep Navy** | #1A1A2E | Primary backgrounds, headers |
| **Electric Blue** | #4361EE | CTAs, interactive elements, links |
| **Bright Teal** | #00D9FF | Accents, highlights, success states |
| **Warm Gold** | #FFD700 | Mollars, achievements, rewards |
| **Soft White** | #F8F9FA | Text on dark backgrounds, cards |
| **Charcoal** | #2D2D2D | Body text on light backgrounds |

**Accent Colors (Mollar Tiers):**

| Mollar | Color | Hex |
|--------|-------|-----|
| Bronze | Copper | #B87333 |
| Silver | Silver | #C0C0C0 |
| Gold | Gold | #FFD700 |

| UI Labels | Inter | Medium (500) | 14px |
| Watch UI | SF Pro (system) | Variable | Per watchOS HIG |

### 2.4 Logo Usage

The logo should incorporate:
- The "6-7" numerical identity
- Suggestion of progression/leveling up
- Playful but not childish (appeals to kids AND parents)
- Works in both color and monochrome

**Logo Lockup Options:**
1. Icon only (for app icons, favicons)
2. Horizontal lockup (icon + wordmark)
3. Stacked lockup (icon above wordmark)
